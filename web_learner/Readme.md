c. Provide instructions for setting up and running the tests.
5. *Deployment* (using Heroku):
a. Prepare the application for deployment by adding necessary configuration files, such as a *`Procfile`* for Heroku.
b. Set up a Heroku account and create a new application.
c. Connect the application to a remote MongoDB instance using a cloud-based service like MongoDB Atlas.
d. Deploy the application to Heroku using the Heroku CLI or by connecting the application's repository to Heroku via GitHub integration.
e. Provide clear instructions for deployment and environment configuration, including setting up environment variables for database connections and other sensitive information.
6. *Documentation*:
a. Write clear and concise documentation on how to set up, run, and use the web application.
